			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<h3>
				I began self-studying web development after being mesmerised by
				what I could create with code. I enjoy being able to combine
				both my passion for design and my love for technology and
				problem-solving.

				tech career on the Grayce Tech+ Graduate Development Programme
				which shapes emerging talent into future tech leaders. I am
				currently on assigment with a multinational technology
				corporation nationwide to help them implement a high-level
